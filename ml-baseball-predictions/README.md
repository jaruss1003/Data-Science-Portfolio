# MLB Game Outcome Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict the outcome of Major League Baseball (MLB) games based on historical data. The goal is to build a basic classification model that predicts whether a team will win or lose using factors like team stats, starting pitchers, and game location.

## Project Goals
- Load and explore historical MLB game data
- Preprocess the data for training
- Train a machine learning model (e.g. Logistic Regression or Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance

## Folder Structure
- `baseball_predictions.py`: Main script
- `data/`: Contains CSV or dataset files
- `outputs/`: Contains plots, reports, and saved models

## Status
In Progress
