# MLB Game Outcome Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict the outcomes of Major League Baseball (MLB) games based on historical data. The goal is to build a basic classification model that predicts whether a team will win or lose using features like team statistics, starting pitchers, and game location.

## Project Goals
- Load and explore historical MLB game data
- Preprocess the data (cleaning, encoding, feature selection)
- Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest)
- Evaluate the model’s performance with accuracy metrics and visualizations

## Folder Structure
- `baseball_predictions.py` — Main script for data analysis and modeling
- `data/` — Contains the dataset (`mlb_games.csv`)
- `outputs/` — Stores generated plots, confusion matrices, or model results

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Add your dataset to the `data/` folder
3. Run the `baseball_predictions.py` script to begin training

## Status
**In Progress** — Currently in the early stages of development and experimentation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
