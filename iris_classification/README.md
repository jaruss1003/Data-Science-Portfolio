# Iris Classification Project

This project uses the classic Iris dataset to build and evaluate two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

### Features:
- Data exploration and visualization (pairplot, histograms, correlation heatmap)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Model training and evaluation using classification reports and confusion matrices
- Visual outputs saved as PNG files

### Models:
- **Logistic Regression** with standardized inputs
- **Random Forest Classifier** without scaling

### Output Files:
- `feature_histograms.png`
- `pairplot.png`
- `confusion_matrix_rf.png`

### Dataset:
- Built-in Iris dataset from `seaborn`

This was my first data science project as a beginner and part of my journey to build technical skills for a career in data science and national security.
